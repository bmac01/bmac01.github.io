			<p>I am a Chartered Certified Accountant, with over 15 years’ progressive experience within Shared Service Finance functions and Financial Services. My experience has been gained within the areas of US GAAP accounting, tax strategy, local statutory and compliance, budget and cost management, internal controls and the delivery of Finance transformation projects.</p>

			<p>I have built, managed and developed high-performing teams in a management position within Accenture for over seven years, consistently delivering results and expanding our team in Dublin.</p>

			<p>I have a proven track record of delivering and supporting complex strategic projects, partnering with internal stakeholders to achieve shared goals.</p>

			<p>I am an effective communicator with strong negotiating and influencing skills, who believes in maintaining a “no surprises” approach at all times. As I engage with a lot of non-finance executives, I have become adept at conveying complex information in a concise and meaningful way to enable them to make sound strategic decisions.</p>

			<p>Having worked in Accenture for over ten years, I am looking for a new opportunity to expand my expertise and
				progress my career.</p> 

			<p>Please find enclosed my CV. Should you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

			<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

			<p>Yours sincerely </p>
			<p>Barry McCabe</p> <br>
